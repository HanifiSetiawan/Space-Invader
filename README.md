# Space-Invader
I am going to create a simple space invaders game using JavaFX. Space Invaders is an arcade video game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was first released in 1978. My plan for the game is, at first there will be 24 invaders (aliens), These aliens will heavily shell the ground. The player shoots with the Left mouse click. Aliens will rush the player, trying to colide. Each alien has its own speed. After passing a certain time, the player will get a certain power-up, also the aliens will go faster.
* Im going to make it using JavaFX in Eclipse IDE!
* Its Playable now, but not completely finish yet, you need to download the image to play it!
